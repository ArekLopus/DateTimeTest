//		ZoneId		- public abstract class ZoneId implements Serializable
//-Direct Known Subclasses: ZoneOffset

//-A time-zone ID, such as Europe/Paris.
//-A ZoneId is used to identify the rules used to convert between an Instant and a LocalDateTime. There are two distinct types of ID:
// • Fixed offsets - a fully resolved offset from UTC/Greenwich, that uses the same offset for all local date-times
// • Geographical regions - an area where a specific set of rules for finding the offset from UTC/Greenwich apply
//-Most fixed offsets are represented by ZoneOffset.
// Calling normalized() on any ZoneId will ensure that a fixed offset ID will be represented as a ZoneOffset.

//-The actual rules, describing when and how the offset changes, are defined by ZoneRules. This class is simply an ID used to obtain
// the underlying rules. This approach is taken because rules are defined by governments and change frequently, whereas the ID is stable.
//
//-The distinction has other effects. Serializing the ZoneId will only send the ID, whereas serializing the rules sends the entire data set.
// Similarly, a comparison of two IDs only examines the ID, whereas a comparison of two rules examines the entire data set.

//	Time-zone IDs
//-The ID is unique within the system. There are three types of ID.
//-The simplest type of ID is that from ZoneOffset. This consists of 'Z' and IDs starting with '+' or '-'.
//
//-The next type of ID are offset-style IDs with some form of prefix, such as 'GMT+2' or 'UTC+01:00'.
//-The recognised prefixes are 'UTC', 'GMT' and 'UT'.
//-The offset is the suffix and will be normalized during creation. These IDs can be normalized to a ZoneOffset using normalized().
//
//-The third type of ID are region-based IDs. A region-based ID must be of two or more characters, and not start with 'UTC', 'GMT',
// 'UT' '+' or '-'. Region-based IDs are defined by configuration, see ZoneRulesProvider.
// The configuration focuses on providing the lookup from the ID to the underlying ZoneRules.
//
//-Time-zone rules are defined by governments and change frequently. There are a number of organizations, known here as groups,
// that monitor time-zone changes and collate them. The default group is the IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB).
// Other organizations include IATA (the airline industry body) and Microsoft.
//
//-Each group defines its own format for the region ID it provides. The TZDB group defines IDs such as 'Europe/London' or 'America/New_York'.
// TZDB IDs take precedence over other groups.
//
//-It is strongly recommended that the group name is included in all IDs supplied by groups other than TZDB to avoid conflicts.
// For example, IATA airline time-zone region IDs are typically the same as the three letter airport code.
// However, the airport of Utrecht has the code 'UTC', which is obviously a conflict. The recommended format for region IDs from groups 
// other than TZDB is 'group~region'. Thus if IATA data were defined, Utrecht airport would be 'IATA~UTC'.

//	Serialization
//-This class can be serialized and stores the string zone ID in the external form.
// The ZoneOffset subclass uses a dedicated format that only stores the offset from UTC/Greenwich.
// A ZoneId can be deserialized in a Java Runtime where the ID is unknown. Fe, if a server-side Java Runtime has been updated with a new
// zone ID, but the client-side Java Runtime has not been updated. In this case, the ZoneId object will exist, and can be queried using getId,
// equals, hashCode, toString, getDisplayName and normalized. However, any call to getRules will fail with ZoneRulesException. This approach
// is designed to allow a ZonedDateTime to be loaded and queried, but not modified, on a Java Runtime with incomplete time-zone information.
//
//-This is a value-based class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality (==), identity hash code,
// or synchronization) on instances of ZoneId may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
//-The equals method should be used for comparisons.

//-This abstract class has two implementations, both of which are immutable and thread-safe.
// One implementation models region-based IDs, the other is ZoneOffset modelling offset-based IDs. This difference is visible in serialization.
