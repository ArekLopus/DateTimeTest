//-UTC is the time at the Greenwich Royal Observatory, without daylight savings time.

// • All java.time objects are immutable.
// • An Instant is a point on the time line (similar to a Date).
// • In Java time, each day has exactly 86,400 seconds (i.e., no leap seconds). Ii is defined as an offset since the origin (called an epoch).
// • A Duration is the difference between two instants.
// • LocalDateTime has no time zone information.
// • TemporalAdjuster methods handle common calendar computations, such as finding the first Tuesday of a month.
// • ZonedDateTime is a point in time in a given time zone (similar to GregorianCalendar).
// • Use a Period, not a Duration, when advancing zoned time, in order to account for daylight savings time changes.
// • Use DateTimeFormatter to format and parse dates and times.
