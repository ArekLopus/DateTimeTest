package local_tiime;

//		LocalTime	- class LocalTime implements Temporal, TemporalAdjuster, Comparable<LocalTime>, Serializable
//-A time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as 10:15:30.
//-LocalTime is an immutable date-time object that represents a time, often viewed as hour-minute-second.
//-Time is represented to nanosecond precision. For example, the value "13:45.30.123456789" can be stored in a LocalTime.
//
//-This class does not store or represent a date or time-zone.
//-Instead, it is a description of the local time as seen on a wall clock.
//-It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information such as an offset or time-zone.
//
//-The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today in most of the world.
// This API assumes that all calendar systems use the same representation, this class, for time-of-day.
//
//-This is a value-based class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality (==), identity hash code,
// or synchronization) on instances of LocalTime may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
//-The equals method should be used for comparisons.
//
//-This class is immutable and thread-safe.
